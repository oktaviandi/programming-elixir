# Programming Elixir
This repository contains the exercises from the Programming Elixir book which is organised by the chapter. I've only created exercises from Chapter 5 onwards as they're the more intersting ones.

The file naming is a bit inconsistent. Some are named based on the exercise title. And some are just named by the context. It's what it is :bow:

Feel free to comment on the codes :)
